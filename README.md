# VeRoLog_logistic_problem_solution
This repository contains implementations of three optimization algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for solving logistics scheduling problems. The goal is to optimize the allocation of trucks and technicians to service locations while minimizing costs.
